Once this is taken care of, the Libra can then blossom.”<br>“Once you lie to a Libra, they will forever doubt everything you say and do.” <br> “Im a Libra, I always have two sides of everything.” <br> “Libras dont “lose it”. They keep their cool even in chaos.” <br> “Libras receive great pleasure by pleasing and helping others.” <br> “Libra kiss like they wanna put a spell over you… and they will.” <br> “Libra dont mind being alone. They can even talk to themselves.” <br> “Libra can read your thoughts through your body language alone.” <br> “Libra: Hanging out with myself is honestly a vibe. Just me and my music.” <br> “A Libra will act as if everything is okay even when things are falling apart.” <br> “A libra is skilled enough to be one step ahead, but make you believe they are one step behind.” <br> “Libras have an excellent memory, so you should probably watch what you say around them.” <br> “A Libra will never tell you something straightaway, instead, theyll sit with it until they feel its the right time.” <br> “It’s hard to make a Libra jealous because they know what theyre worth and know that they can have anyone they want.”</p>
